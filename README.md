### Date created
11th December, 2021

### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I compared the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

### Files used
For this project, I had to write a Python script. To help guide my work, a template with helper code and comments was provided in a bikeshare.py file, and you I did my scripting in there also. I also used the three city dataset files too:

    chicago.csv
    new_york_city.csv
    washington.csv
